Frontend Assignment

Dear interviewee,

Welcome to the assignment.

All your assignment code instances must be removed from the internet after your next interview, do not share them with anyone.

While you are not required to complete all of the tasks mentioned in the code, we encourage you to explain what you tried and what approaches you took while working on them.

Submit your solution (the links to your applications) by e-mail or other allowed means at least 24 hours before your next interview.

Best of luck!
